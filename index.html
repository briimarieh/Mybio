                    If I have free time I love to draw, paint, and craft. I recently started experimenting with using watercolor paint. I most like to make dream catchers.

                    Ever since I was young I have founf a love in roller skating. While I have been taking a break from it due to a fall, I cannot wait to get back into it, but with more padding this time.

                    I found my love of baking in high school where I took a couple of culinary classes. While they did not solely focus on baking, we did bake quite often, and I fell in love.

                    My high school had a program called APEX, which stood for Aspiring Professional Experience. Here we could choose a career that we were interested in and we would go out and experience it. I chose Animal Sciences. In this class we got to shadow vets, volunteer at the animal rescue league and the zoo, and we got to participate in other environmental career experiences.

                    About a year ago I worked as a kitchen manager at a convenience store. I managed to get this position at 19 years old after working hard for the company for 3 years. While I enjoyed the position, I unfortunately had to leave the company.
